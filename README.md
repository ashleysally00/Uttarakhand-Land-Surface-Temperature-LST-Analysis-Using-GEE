 ## Uttarakhand Land Surface Temperature (LST) Analysis for Fire Prediction ML

We worked together as an international team through Omdena to build an AI-powered forest fire prediction and early warning system for Uttarakhand, India. Using satellite-based Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, Google Earth Engine, and Python, our goal was to understand how ground temperature patterns influence wildfire behavior and improve early detection strategies.
This repository contains my individual contribution to Omdena’s *AI-Powered Forest Fire Prediction and Early Warning System for Uttarakhand*. I carried out preprocessing and exploratory data analysis of Land Surface Temperature (LST) data using Google Earth Engine (via its Python API), and I wrote the onboarding documentation to help collaborators set up and reproduce the workflow. I also conducted domain research, including an [interview with a California wildfire Public Information Officer](Interview-with-wildfire-PIO.md), to ensure the features and workflow aligned with real-world fire management needs.

Land Surface Temperature (LST) measures the temperature of the Earth's surface, which includes soil, vegetation, and built-up areas. It is derived from satellite thermal infrared data and reflects the heat emitted from the ground. This thermal information helps assess how different surfaces interact with heat - a critical factor in determining wildfire risk. <br> <br>

___
To better predict how fires might behave in the future, we analyzed data from **January 2012 to June 30, 2024**, focusing on Uttarakhand (though you can modify the geographic region to suit your specific research).

The analysis uses Google Earth Engine (GEE) to process the `MODIS/061/MOD11A1` dataset. The data is clipped to any user-defined region using a shapefile, resampled to 500m resolution, and exported for further analysis.

The files for the mean LST day and for 2024 mean LST day and 2024 mean LST night are too large to include directly in this repository. However, if you'd like to access them, you can view or download them from my DagsHub repository: [Uttarakhand-Land-Surface-Temperature-LST-Analysis-Using-GEE](https://dagshub.com/ashleysally00/Uttarakhand-Land-Surface-Temperature-LST-Analysis-Using-GEE). Please note: You may need to sign in to DagsHub to download large files, even though the repository is public.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Authenticate GEE and Google Drive when prompted

4. **Download the Outputs**:
   - Access the exported files from your Google Drive folder (default: EarthEngineExports)
___
## Output

### 1. Mean LST (Day and Night)
- The Colab notebook processes and exports the **mean daytime and nighttime LST** data for the entire time range (**January 2012 to June 30, 2024**).
- These GeoTIFF files summarize the average Land Surface Temperature for the given period.
- **Accessing the Output**:
  - The files are saved in Google Drive under the folder `EarthEngineExports`.
  - The filenames are:
    - `Mean_LST_Day.tif` (for daytime mean)
    - `Mean_LST_Night.tif` (for nighttime mean).

### 2. Daily Time-Series LST (Day and Night)
To extract daily LST data for the specified time range (**January 2012 to June 30, 2024**), additional Python code needs to be added to the Colab notebook. This processes and exports daily LST data as GeoTIFF files for both daytime and nighttime.

### 3. Accessing Daily LST Outputs
- **Google Drive Location**:
  - Daily LST outputs are saved in the folder `EarthEngineExports/Daily` in your Google Drive.
  - Each file is named in the format:
    - `LST_Day_YYYY-MM-DD.tif` (e.g., `LST_Day_2012-01-01.tif` for daytime LST on January 1, 2012)
    - `LST_Night_YYYY-MM-DD.tif` (e.g., `LST_Night_2012-01-01.tif` for nighttime LST on January 1, 2012).

- **Processing Time**:
  - Exporting daily LST data for an extended time range (**January 2012 to June 30, 2024**) may take a while.
  - Below is an example of the Colab output during the process:

* Analysis of temperature patterns and their relationship to wildfire risk
* Detailed explanation of map features and interpretation

## Python Code for Daily LST Exports
Add the following Python code to the end of your Colab notebook to generate and export the daily LST data:

```python
import datetime
import ee

# Authenticate and initialize Earth Engine (if not already done)
ee.Authenticate()
ee.Initialize()

# Load the MODIS LST dataset
modis = ee.ImageCollection("MODIS/061/MOD11A1")

# Load the Uttarakhand shapefile (replace with your shapefile's Asset ID)
uttarakhand = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/ee-your-project-id/assets/Uttarakhand-boundary")

# Generate a list of dates from 2012-01-01 to 2024-06-30
start_date = datetime.date(2012, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime.date(2024, 6, 30)
dates = [start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=i) for i in range((end_date - start_date).days + 1)]

# Iterate through each date and process LST data
for date in dates:
    date_str = date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    print(f"Processing LST data for {date_str}...")
    
    # Filter MODIS dataset for the specific date
    daily_modis = modis.filterDate(date_str, (date + datetime.timedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
    
    # Clip and resample to 500m
    daily_modis_clipped = daily_modis.map(lambda img: img.clip(uttarakhand))
    daily_modis_resampled = daily_modis_clipped.map(
        lambda img: img.resample('bilinear').reproject(crs='EPSG:4326', scale=500)
    )
    
    # Extract Daytime and Nighttime LST
    daily_lst_day = daily_modis_resampled.select('LST_Day_1km').mean().multiply(0.02).rename('LST_Day_K')
    daily_lst_night = daily_modis_resampled.select('LST_Night_1km').mean().multiply(0.02).rename('LST_Night_K')

    # Export daily data to Google Drive
    ee.batch.Export.image.toDrive(
        image=daily_lst_day,
        description=f'LST_Day_{date_str}',
        folder='EarthEngineExports/Daily',
        fileNamePrefix=f'LST_Day_{date_str}',
        region=uttarakhand.geometry(),
        scale=500,
        crs='EPSG:4326',
        maxPixels=1e13
    ).start()

    ee.batch.Export.image.toDrive(
        image=daily_lst_night,
        description=f'LST_Night_{date_str}',
        folder='EarthEngineExports/Daily',
        fileNamePrefix=f'LST_Night_{date_str}',
        region=uttarakhand.geometry(),
        scale=500,
        crs='EPSG:4326',
        maxPixels=1e13
    ).start()
```
## How to Monitor Your Export Progress

When processing large datasets, it's helpful to monitor the progress of your export tasks in the **Inspector Console** of the Google Earth Engine Code Editor. After you run the code to export files, you can check the **Tasks tab** to see the status of each export. This allows you to:

* Confirm that the export has started.
* See the approximate time it will take for the file(s) to download.
* Identify and debug any errors if the task fails.

Below is an example of what the **Inspector Console** looks like while a task is running:

![Inspector Console Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashleysally00/Uttarakhand-Land-Surface-Temperature-LST-Analysis-Using-GEE/main/inspectorconsole.png)

## Steps to Monitor Exports

1. Go to the **Tasks tab** in the Google Earth Engine Code Editor.
2. Look for your export task(s). Each task will have:
   * **Phase**: This shows whether the task is queued, running, or completed.
   * **Submitted Time**: When the task was initiated.
   * **Estimated Time**: The approximate time left for completion (if available).
3. Wait for the task's status to change to **Completed**.
4. Once completed, the exported file(s) can be found in the folder you specified in your code (e.g., `EarthEngineExports` in Google Drive).


The following outputs are generated:

1. **Mean LST (Day and Night)**:
   - GeoTIFF files summarizing mean daytime and nighttime LST over the specified time range

2. **Daily Time-Series**:
   - A stack of daily LST data as GeoTIFF or CSV files for analysis

## Handling Task Queue Errors

When processing and downloading large datasets such as daily LST data over a long time range, you may encounter the following error:

![Too Many Tasks Error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashleysally00/Uttarakhand-Land-Surface-Temperature-LST-Analysis-Using-GEE/main/too-many-tasks-gee.png)

### What Does This Mean?

This error occurs because Google Earth Engine enforces a limit of 3000 queued tasks per user. When exporting data for each day across multiple years, the number of tasks can easily exceed this limit.

### Solutions to Address the Task Limit

1. **Filter by Year and Process One Year at a Time**
   
   To avoid submitting too many tasks at once, you can filter the dataset to process and export data one year at a time:

   ```python
   # Define the year to process
   year = 2012
   start_date = datetime.date(year, 1, 1)
   end_date = datetime.date(year, 12, 31)
   dates = [start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=i) for i in range((end_date - start_date).days + 1)]

   # Iterate through each date and process LST data for the selected year
   for date in dates:
       date_str = date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
       print(f"Processing LST data for {date_str}...")
     
   ```

2. **Use Task Monitoring**
   
   To avoid overwhelming the task queue, modify the code to submit tasks one at a time and wait for their completion:

   ```python
   # Export daily data to Google Drive with task monitoring
   export_task_day = ee.batch.Export.image.toDrive(
       image=daily_lst_day,
       description=f'LST_Day_{date_str}',
       folder='EarthEngineExports/Daily',
       fileNamePrefix=f'LST_Day_{date_str}',
       region=uttarakhand.geometry(),
       scale=500,
       crs='EPSG:4326',
       maxPixels=1e13
   )
   export_task_day.start()

   export_task_night = ee.batch.Export.image.toDrive(
       image=daily_lst_night,
       description=f'LST_Night_{date_str}',
       folder='EarthEngineExports/Daily',
       fileNamePrefix=f'LST_Night_{date_str}',
       region=uttarakhand.geometry(),
       scale=500,
       crs='EPSG:4326',
       maxPixels=1e13
   )
   export_task_night.start()

   # Wait for the tasks to complete before starting the next iteration
   while export_task_day.active() or export_task_night.active():
       print(f"Waiting for tasks to complete for {date_str}...")
       time.sleep(60)  # Wait for 60 seconds before checking again
   ```
